# Postfix Send-Only Docker Image


## ATTENTION:
_This image is meant to be used in a Docker-Compose environment, or to be provided a "real" [main.cf](data/conf/postfix/main.cf) first.
Please do it before finding out that the included is a default dummy config, and before opening issues for a not-working image.
It is not meant to be ready out-of-the-box._

Do not forget to add your configurations in `data/conf/postfix/main.cf`!
